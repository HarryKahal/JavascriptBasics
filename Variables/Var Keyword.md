Function scope means 
    if var variable declare inside in the function then it will shown error if try to access that variable outside the function.
 
Block scope means 
    if variable declare inside a function under if block then it only accessible in that block.

Hoisting means 
    process of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope, regardless of where they are actually declared in the code.
